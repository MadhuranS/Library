A project that helped dive deeper into Object Orientated programming by creating a librar/booklist website. Had some trouble with the project due to lack of planning and preparation for certain problems. This will help me be better prepared to work on future issues while also exposing me to some common issues I might face. I will definitely prepare more in advance for future projects.
